BaDe - The Bash Deployer

Collection of bash scripts used for deploying web applications.

scripts :
- bade-nexus.sh  : manipulate and download artifacts from the Nexus Repository Manager
- bade-tomcat.sh : manipulate Tomcat (start/stop) and deploy WAR
- bade-jsvc.sh   : manipulate JSVC (start/stop) and deploy JAR

configuration :
- bade-nexus.conf  : config file for accessing Nexus


How the Tomcat deployment works :
- Tomcat should already be installed in each host, and the env var CATALINA_HOME should be defined
- An env var WEBAPPS_BASE should be set the a valid path where the script will create all the CATALINA_BASE directories (1 for each webapp)
- The webapp should be packaged as a .war file in the Nexus repository manager
- The tomcat conf for the webapp should be packaged as a .tar.gz file in the Nexus repository manager, named "${WEBAPP_NAME}-tomcat-conf", 
  and with the environment ('prod', 'preprod', 'qa', 'dev', ...) as the classifier (see nexus/maven doc)
